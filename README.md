A front-end form which collects contact input from user.

Questions:  

- I think the 'id' of each participant should be handled from the back-end. So why did you have it required in this problem? 
- Also, could you please share how you would handle it from the back-end and/or front-end?
- I couldn't get the HTTP 200 response. Instead, I got HTTP 201. Could you please let me know what part of my code could be changed to meet this requirement?
- I'm still working on the message when a form is sucessfully submitted. 

I'm looking forward to your feedbacks on my code. Thank you!

A front-end form which collects contact input from user.

Questions: 
    - I think the 'id' of each participant should be handled from the back-end. So why did you have it required in this problem? 
    - Also, could you please share how you would handle it from the back-end and/or front-end?
    - I couldn't get the HTTP 200 response. Instead, I got HTTP 201. Could you please let me know what part of my code could be changed to meet this requirement?

This problem was enjoyable! I could applied what I've learned about React so far (I'm following the fullstackopen course, and is currently at the part about Forms), and also had learned alot more along the way.  
I'm looking forward to your feedbacks on my code.  

Thank you for this opportunity!
